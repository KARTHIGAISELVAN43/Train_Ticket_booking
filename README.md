🚆 Train Ticket Booking System
📌 Project Description

The Train Ticket Booking System is a software application that allows users to search trains, book tickets, cancel bookings, and view reservation details in a simple and efficient way.
It aims to digitalize the traditional railway ticket booking process by providing a user-friendly interface and managing backend operations like passenger details, train schedules, and payment tracking.
